# Using the AWS DeepComposer Music studio to create tracks 

The AWS DeepComposer music studio allows you to create music using trained models. To create your next masterpiece 
you can record a custom input track, use a sample input track, or import a .midi track. 

After choosing the **Source of input melody** you can start generating compositions. 

## Getting started 
Browser support for the AWS DeepComposer console varies. We *recommend* using Chrome for this lab. If you want to know
more about which features are supported by different browsers check out the [Browser support documenation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/deepcomposer/latest/devguide/browser-support.html). 

>**Note** The exercises in this lab assume you've signed in to the AWS DeepComposer console. To use the AWS DeepComposer
>console and other AWS services, you need an AWS account. If you don't have an account, see [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/)
>and choose **Create and AWS account**. For detailed instructions, see [Create and Activate an AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/)
