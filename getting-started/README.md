# Getting started with AWS DeepComposer

With AWS DeepComposer, you can experiment with different generative AI architectures and models in a musical setting. 
You can use AWS DeepComposer to develop a working knowledge of generative AI. AWS DeepComposer includes learning capsules, 
sample code, and training data to help you understand and use generative AI models. 

If you are new machine learning (ML), you can get started by jumping into the [AWS DeepComposer Music studio](https://console.aws.amazon.com/deepcomposer/home?region=us-east-1#musicStudio)
and the [AWS DeepComposer Learning capsules](https://console.aws.amazon.com/deepcomposer/home?region=us-east-1#learningCapsules).

If you are an aspiring ML developer you can dive deep by starting to train your own customer generative AI model. You can currently 
train a [generative adversarial network (GAN) model](lab-2), [autoregressive convolutional neural network (AR-CNN model)](../ar-cnn),
and a [Transformer-XL model](../transformer-xl).

**Important - Browser requirements**
>AWS DeepComposer fully supports the Chrome browser. Other browsers offer limited support for the AWS DeepComposer 
> console and hardware. For more information about browser compatibility, see [Browser support for AWS DeepComposer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/deepcomposer/latest/devguide/browser-support.html).
