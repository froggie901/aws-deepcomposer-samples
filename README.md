# AWS DeepComposer Samples  

 This repository contains example notebooks and projects that show how to apply machine learning (ML) and
 Generative AI techniques. Each subdirectory contains sample code for using Amazon Machine Learning. 
 Refer to the `README.md` file in each sub-directory for details on using each project.  
 
 ## Getting started
 Each project in this repository is different. The first lab, [Compose music with DeepComposer models](Lab%201) is an
 introduction to recording custom songs using the Music studio. In the second lab, we use Amazon SageMaker to [train a
 custom GAN](Lab%202).   
 
 
 ### Prereq
 
 ## FAQ 
 
*Will these examples work outside of Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instances?*

Although most examples utilize key Amazon SageMaker functionality like distributed, managed training or real-time
hosted endpoints, these notebooks can be run outside of Amazon SageMaker Notebook Instances with minimal
modification (updating IAM role definition and installing the necessary libraries).

*How do I contribute my own example notebook?*

Although we're extremely excited to receive contributions from the community, we're still working on the best mechanism
to take in examples from external sources. Please bear with us in the short-term if pull requests take longer than expected or are closed.

*I am struggling to get a notebook example to work properly*

If you believe that a notebook isn't working properly you can file an [issue](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-deepcomposer-samples/issues).
You can also connect with the DeepComposer community via the [AWS DeepComposer Forum]()
