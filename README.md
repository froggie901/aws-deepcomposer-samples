## AWS DeepComposer samples repository 

Welcome to the AWS DeepComposer samples repository. In this repository you will find [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html)
files that can be used to train custom models. There is also information about how to get started with AWS DeepComposer.
If you are interested in contributing to this repository, see [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md). 

## What is AWS DeepComposer? 

AWS DeepComposer provides a creative, hands-on experience for learning generative AI and machine learning. With generative AI, one of the biggest recent advancements in artificial intelligence. With AWS DeepComposer, you can experiment with different generative AI architectures and models by creating and transforming musical inputs and accompaniments to create compositions.

Regardless of your experience with machine learning (ML) or music, you can use AWS DeepComposer to develop a working
knowledge of generative AI. AWS DeepComposer includes learning capsules, sample code, and training data to help you
understand and use generative AI models.
